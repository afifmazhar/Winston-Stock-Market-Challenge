# Winston-Stock-Market-Challenge
A condensed version of the Winston Stock Market Challenge.

Data was used to predict the stock market fluctuation in a particular stock. We used a linear regression model and trained it to predict the stock market fluctuation in price over the next couple of seconds.

This project included data cleaning, machine learning, linear regression, data visualizations. All code was completed using the Python language.
